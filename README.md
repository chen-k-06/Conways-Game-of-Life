# Conway's Game of Life
The Game of Life, also known as Conway's Game of Life or simply Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input..
The game is played on a 2D grid of squares. Each square (or "cell") on the grid can be either alive or dead, and they evolve according to the following rules:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (referred to as underpopulation).
2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (referred to as overpopulation).
3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours comes to life.

A neighbor is any of the 8 cells adjacent to a given cell, including diagonals.
The initial configuration of cells can be created by a human, but all generations thereafter are completely determined by the above rules. The goal of the game is to find patterns that evolve in interesting ways
