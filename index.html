            To play, draw patterns by clicking on squares and then press "START". To reset the board, press
            "REFRESH". To access the Github, press "GITHUB".<br><br>
            Each square (or "cell") on the grid can be either alive or dead, and they evolve according to the
            following rules: <br><br>

            1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (referred to as underpopulation).<br>
            2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (referred to as overpopulation).<br>
            3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.<br>
            4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours comes to life.<br><br>

            Alive cells are black. Dead cells are white.<br><br>The initial configuration of cells can be created by a
            human, but all generations thereafter are completely determined by the above rules. The goal of the game is
            to find patterns that evolve in interesting ways.<br></p>
